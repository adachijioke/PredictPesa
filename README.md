> **"Stake Bitcoin. Forecast Everything. Trade Your Belief."**

PredictPesa is a DeFi-native, AI-powered prediction market protocol built on Hedera that transforms predictions into tradeable financial primitives. Users across Africa and globally can stake Bitcoin to forecast real-world outcomes—elections, FX rates, sports, food prices, rainfall, and more—while earning yield-bearing position tokens that integrate seamlessly with the broader DeFi ecosystem.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

Africa's $40B+ betting market is dominated by centralized platforms with:
- **Opaque odds** and unfair house edges
- **Limited payout options** and currency restrictions  
- **No asset composability** - winnings can't be invested or used as collateral
- **Censorship risks** and regulatory uncertainties
- **Lack of local relevance** - few markets about African events

Meanwhile, global prediction markets like Polymarket and Augur have:
- **High barriers to entry** (complex UX, gas fees)
- **USD-centric design** limiting emerging market access
- **Western-focused events** with minimal African representation
